    <p>There are 4 major ways to implement a webpage layout in HTML, all of them are based on CSS. They are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            CSS Framework - This gives you pre-made templates from using frameworks like W3.CSS or bootstrap
        </li>
        <li>
            CSS Grid - This is a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it unnecessary to use floats
            and positioning.
        </li>
        <li>
            CSS Float Layout
        </li>
        <li>
            CSS Flexbox
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src=img_1.png alt="image" class=A> This is an image that must move to the left of my screen and wrap my text
        around it</p>

    <p>Lets see what happens if I add more text. Clearly this gets repeated until my image has been past, post which I
        will once again gain access to my entire page. Hence you must adjust the height and the width of your picture
        accrodingly</p>

    <h3>The following are the elements of any HTML page</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Section - A group of contents usually having the same theme/heading</li>
        <li>Article - This is independant content. That means it should make sense in itself and you can place it
            anywhere on the webpage. You use this when you're writing blog posts or newspaper articles</li>
        <li>Header - Introductory content like the heading using h1-h6 and/or a logo</li>
        <li>Footer - This can have many compotents like author, contact info, back to the top links, etc</li>
        <li>nav - This is the navigation bar. Usually you would like to put it right below the header. This does not
            necessarily have to have all the navigation links on the page</li>
        <li>Aside - This defines some content on the side, like a sidebar</li>
    </ol>
