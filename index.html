    <h1>Paragraphs</h1>
    <p>Lets call this paragraph 1, the introduction.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The previous
                line is called 
            a horizontal line break.

    <p>Note the difference in formatting in those two paragraphs</p>
    <p>You can also divide a line <br>using the break tag as we have out here.</p>

    <h1>Styles</h1>
    <p>The syntax of the style elements and attributes is tagname style="property:value;"</p>
    <p>The following are the properties to choose from:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Background-color for background color</li>

        <li>Font-size for text sizes</li>

    </ol>
    <p style="background-color:black; color:white; font-family:Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:160%; text-align:center;">This is a paragraph that has been styled using CSS.</p>

    <h1>Formatting</h1>
    <p><b>This text is bold.</b><strong> This text is strong emphasized.</strong> So what is the difference?</p>
    <p><i>This text is italicised.</i><em> This text is emphasized.</em> So what is the difference?</p>

    <h1>Quotations</h1>
    <p>The following statement is in blockquote and is cited to Google</p>
    <blockquote title="Google Cited" cite="https://google.com" style="text-align:center">
    Quotations are usually indented as you will see here. They can also be given a title which you will notice if you hover your mouse over this paragraph. Quotations don't necessarily have to be within paragraph tags but it is great if they are.<br><br><cite>Karan Samat</cite>
    </blockquote>
    <address>
        This is an address<br>
        Usually it is in italics<br>
